This project aims to port the Liquid Templating Language over to ColdFusion. For the port I'm using the PHP port of the language.

Currect State
=============

The port is complete. Now just need to get tests passing. currently there are 9 failures and 0 errors.

Running Tests
=============

Tests are written using the RocketUnit framework. To run the tests first clone the project into a directory off your webroot called `cfml-liquid`. Next point your browser to `http://localhost/cfml-liquid/tests`.
